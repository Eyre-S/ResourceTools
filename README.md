## Introduction

ResourceTools is a project that allows developers, especially new Java developers, to no longer have the problem of getting resource files with full of problems in Java.

Through this toolkit, you can use `resources/` in your classpath just like using `java.io.File` in disk. Whether before or after packaging, you can always get resources with a piece of code.

## End

In the end, thanks to everyone supporting me in the past years. This project is my FIRST project has some real purpose, also my FIRST project I am going to do it for the public.

I am using this project v0.2.x in those years in many my other projects, although it is very immature and has many bugs. So I decide to update, or says to remake this project now. I kept the old Thanks To paragraphs, and there's *"If there is anything that the describing is not suitable for, just [post an issue](https://github.com/Eyre-S/ResourceTools/issues). If you have any other questions, just [post issue](https://github.com/Eyre-S/ResourceTools/issues) too"* in the old README, I think it suits for now too.
